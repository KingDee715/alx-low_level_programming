# **0x00. C - Hello, World**
This project taught me about learning to program in C, understanding the C program compilation process, compiling with ==gcc==.
### TASKS:note:
 - [0. Preprocessor](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor)
    - A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
    - The C file name will be saved in the variable ==$CFILE==
The output should be saved in the file ==c==

 - [1. Compiler](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler)
    - A script that compiles a C file but does not link.
    - The C file name will be saved in the variable ==$CFILE==
    - The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension ==.o== instead of ==.c==

 - [2. Assembler](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler)
    - A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
    - The C file name will be saved in the variable ==$CFILE==
    - The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension ==.s== instead of ==.c==

 - [3. Name](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/3-name)
    - A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named ==cisfun==.
    - The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE

 - [4. Hello, puts](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c)
    - A C program that prints exactly =="Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle==, followed by a new line.
    - Use the function ==puts==
You are not allowed to use ==printf==
    - Your program should end with the value ==0==

 - [5. Hello, printf](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c)
    - A C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.
    - Use the function ==printf==
    - You are not allowed to use the function ==puts==
    - Your program should return ==0==
    - Your program should compile without warning when using the ==-Wall== ==gcc== option
