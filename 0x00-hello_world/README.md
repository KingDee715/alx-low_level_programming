# **0x00. C - Hello, World**
This project taught me about learning to program in C, understanding the C program compilation process, compiling with <mark>gcc</mark>.
### TASKS :scroll:
 - [0. Preprocessor](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor)
    - A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
    - The C file name will be saved in the variable <mark>$CFILE</mark>
The output should be saved in the file <mark>c</mark>

 - [1. Compiler](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler)
    - A script that compiles a C file but does not link.
    - The C file name will be saved in the variable <mark>$CFILE</mark>
    - The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension <mark>.o</mark> instead of <mark>.c</mark>

 - [2. Assembler](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler)
    - A script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
    - The C file name will be saved in the variable <mark>$CFILE</mark>
    - The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension <mark>.s</mark> instead of <mark>.c</mark>

 - [3. Name](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/3-name)
    - A script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named <mark>cisfun.</mark>.
    - The C file name will be saved in the variable <mark>$CFILE</mark>

 - [4. Hello, puts](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c)
    - A C program that prints exactly <mark>"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle</mark>, followed by a new line.
    - Use the function <mark>puts</mark>
You are not allowed to use <mark>printf</mark>
    - Your program should end with the value <mark>0</mark>

 - [5. Hello, printf](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c)
    - A C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art, , followed by a new line.
    - Use the function <mark>printf</mark>
    - You are not allowed to use the function <mark>puts</mark>
    - Your program should return <mark>0</mark>
    - Your program should compile without warning when using the <mark>-Wall</mark> <mark>gcc</mark> option

 - [6. Size is not grandeur, and territory does not make a nation](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c)
    - A C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
    - You should produce the exact same output as in the example
    - Warnings are allowed
    - Your program should return 0

 - [7. Intel](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/100-intel)
    - A script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
    - The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE.
    - The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c

 - [8. UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c)
    - a C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
    - You are not allowed to use any functions listed in the NAME section of the man (3) printf or man (3) puts
    - Your program should return 1
