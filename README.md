# **Low-level programming & Algorithm**                                        
In here are programs written for low-level programming and algorithm at the Alx Africa Software Engineering course. Below are the projects I'm currently workingon:
 - [0x00. C - Hello, World](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x00-hello_world)
 - [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while)
 - [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops)
 - [0x03. C - debugging](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x03-debugging)
 - [ 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)
 - [0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings](https://github.com/KingDee715/alx-low_level_programming/tree/main/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)
