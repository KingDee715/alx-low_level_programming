# **Low-level programming & Algorithm**                                        
In here are programs written for low-level programming and algorithm at the Alx Africa Software Engineering course. Below are the projects I'm currently workingon:
 - 0x00. C - Hello, World                                                     
 - 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
 - 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
 - 0x03. C - debugging
